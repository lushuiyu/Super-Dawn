# Super-Dawn
 Created based on the Shopify Dawn theme project.
 Integrated with some modern front-end development tools
 - tailwindcss
 - jsminify
 - scss

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Push this repository to your github repository
3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Use an existing Shopify store or create a new one and connect it to your github repository
5. Start the development server using `npm run start` or `yarn start`
6. You will see the files in assets split between the scss folder and the js folder
7. Start editing the files in the scss folder and the js folder, and the changes will be reflected in the browser automatically


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`

This is the most important command of the project

- First it initializes your js and scss folders

- Then turn on file listening

- Finally, link to the shopify development server

### `npm run init` or `yarn init`

Stream the files in the assets folder to the scss folder and js files. 
- Existing files are skipped

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

If your computer is poorly configured or you don't like hot updates. You can use this option
- It only works when you type it

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Shopify themes overview](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/getting-started).

## Future planning
- JavaScript Code obfuscation
- CSS Code obfuscation
